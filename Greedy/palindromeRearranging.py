# Given a string, find out if its characters can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

# Example

# For inputString = "aabb", the output should be
# solution(inputString) = true.

# We can rearrange "aabb" to make "abba", which is a palindrome.


def solution(inputString):
    return sum([inputString.count(i) % 2 for i in set(inputString)]) <= 1
